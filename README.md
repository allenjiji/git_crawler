# git_crawler
GItCrawler is a python webscraping application to create a tree of relation between users.GitCrawler is in its beginning phase as it is single threaded now. 

Run using

``python3 gitcrawler.py <username> <[OPTIONAL]recursionlimit>``

Recursion limit decides the depth of the tree. Try to set recursion limit less while running as the program is not efficient now and is running in single thread. Multi threading will be soon added.
